Code is written with guidance from the book entitled "Python Crash Course" by  Eric Matthes.
The purpose of this book is to learn the basics of the Python programming language.
It is also an excercise in Object-oriented programming where I learned about inheritance, abstraction and things like refactoring.

Add functionality to write the high score in disk, so that it is stored and does not reset whenever the game is booted up.
